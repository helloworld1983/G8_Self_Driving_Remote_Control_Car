INFO: [xilinx.com:ip:axi_bram_ctrl:4.0-2] test_ip: In IP Integrator, please note that memory depth value gets calculated based on the Data Width of the IP and Address range selected in the Address Editor.Incase a validation error occured on the range of this parameter, please check if the selected Data width and the Address Range are valid. For valid Data width and memory depth values, please refer to the AXI BRAM Controller Product Guide.
INFO: [xilinx.com:ip:axi_bram_ctrl:4.0-1] test_ip: In IP Integrator, The Maximum address range supported is 2G. Selecting the address range more than 2G in the address editor may resets the value of Memory depth to default value (1024). please refer to the AXI BRAM Controller Product Guide.
